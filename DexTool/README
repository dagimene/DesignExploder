         Customizing the Modeling Tool

If you need to change the way that elements on
the canvas look, see the file "dsml.css".

If you need to create new menus on the right-click
menu, see the file "dsml.menus".

If you need to customize the palette for the modeling
tool, see the file "dsml.palette".

If you want to plugin your own custom actions that
are invoked when specific events are emitted from
the model, see the file "dsml.triggers".

If you want to create different "views or aspects" for
your model, see the file "dsml.viewdef".

The GEMS user guide is also a very good place to
look for ways to customize the modeling tool. The
older version of the documentation has some aspects
of GEMS documented that are not described in the
newer documentation.
